# LeafClassification-AN2DL

## Introduction 
The goal of this project is to build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in order to classify images of leaves according to the species of the plant to which they belong.

A complete report of the architecture of the network and the achieved results can be found [here](Report.pdf).

## Technologies 
This project has been created with Keras and Tensorflow using Python and Jupyter Notebook.
